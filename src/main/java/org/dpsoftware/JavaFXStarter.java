 * This error comes from sun.launcher.LauncherHelper in the java.base module.
 * The reason for this is that the Main app extends Application and has a main method.
 * If that is the case, the LauncherHelper will check for the javafx.graphics module to be present as a named module.
 * If that module is not present, the launch is aborted.
